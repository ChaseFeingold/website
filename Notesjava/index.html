  <h1>Notes From Chapter 1</h1>
    <h2>Big Ideas</h2>
  <article>
    <h2>HTML.5 makes coding a lot eaiser to code </h2>
  <h2>Java script opens up the door to so many new oppertunites that were previously only possible with plugins. Offline accesibility is also now possiable</h2>
<ol>
  <li> First html.5 works by first the wepage loads your document</li>
  <li>Second an internal mockup of document is created</li>
  <li>Third your webpage loads your java script, typically after the wepage is done loading. </li>
  <li>Lastly the API's give you access to 2d drawings and a bunch of other technologies</li>
</ol>
