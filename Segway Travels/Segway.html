<p>Well I made it 1200 miles already and I passed 
    through some interesting places on the way:
     Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful,
      Ut, Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ and Truth or 
      Consequences, NM. </p>

      <h2>July 14,2012</h2>
      <p> I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side 
        of the road today: "Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity"
        I definitely wont be passing any cars </p>

    <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe 
        finally got everything packed and ready to go. 
        Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring 
        a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPod, digital 
        camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. 
        As Lao Tzu would have said, “A journey of a 
        thousand miles begins with one Segway.”</p>
