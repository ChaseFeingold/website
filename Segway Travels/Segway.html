      <p> I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side 
        of the road today: <blockquote>Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity</blockquote>
        I definitely wont be passing any cars </p>

    <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe 
        finally got everything packed and ready to go. 
        Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring 
        a whole lot with me: cell phone,<br> iPod,<br> digital<br>
        camera,<br> and a protein bar.<br> Just the essentials. 
        As Lao Tzu would have said, “A journey of a 
        thousand miles begins with one Segway.”</p>
